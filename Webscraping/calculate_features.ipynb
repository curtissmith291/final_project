       "'[\\'look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25this is the essential doppelbock as far as I am concerned. it is true as true can be to the style, and is downright delicious. flawlessly made. the pours is a rich mahogany to molasses color with a foamy khaki head a few fingers tall, excellent retention. looks like a lot of body and a lot of malt character, judging by looks alone. the nose is really heavy malt, some roast, some caramel, some dessert or bread pudding type of aromas, and more alcohol than you would think at only 6.7\\', \"look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5A: It poured near black in color with just a few red highlights near the edge of the glass. A moderately-sized light brown head died down and only left a few bubbles floating on the surface.\\\\nS: There are smells of dark malts with some notes of chocolate, raisins and nuts in the aroma.\\\\nT: The taste is very malty and balanced--dark malts dominate the flavors yet there are subtle hints of caramel, chocolate and nuts. There is a bit of sweetness in the initial taste and some dryness in the finish.\\\\nM: It feels medium- to full-bodied and both smooth and thick on the palate.\\\\nD: It was very easy to drink this and the alcohol was barely perceptible. The beer is rather filling and drinking it almost feels like you\\'re having a meal. I would definitely have it again (especially if I was hungry), although there\\'s no way I could have more than one in a single session.Apr 23, 2010\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\", \\'look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fluffy khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, molasses, apple, dark bread, cocoa, light roast, light nuttiness, and light floral. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malty notes and light fruity esters. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, molasses, apple, dark bread, cocoa, roasted malt, light nuttiness, and light smoke. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, dark bread, toast, raisin, apple, roasted malt, cocoa, and light smoke on the finish for a good bit. Excellent flavor balance and complexity of robust malty flavors and light fruity esters; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent doppelbock! Great balance and complexity of robust malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering as expected.Feb 09, 2013\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\\', \\'look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5A - Poured out a solid black color with a foamy, caramel-colored, one-finger head. It left long trails of lace on the glass.\\\\n\\\\nS - It smelled very sweet. There was also some roasted malt and caramel aromas.\\\\n\\\\nT - It had a great sweet maltiness. There was also a good dose of chocolate flavor.\\\\n\\\\nM - It was soft, creamy and smooth. A medium-bodied beer.\\\\n\\\\nD - A really great dopplebock. It is very sweet and chocolatey.Jun 14, 2007\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\\', \\'look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5A beautiful specimen of the Dopplebock style.\\\\n\\\\nThe dark, dark brown beer pours with a soundful plop in the glass. Malty even to the ears. Nearly opaque with a medium, tan head that lasts the session. A good deal of lacing on the glass proves either to be too heavy or verly well malted.\\\\n\\\\nHeavy toast without roasting in the nose. Rye breads, beer breads, grainy breads... the beer is all about the bready-toasty malts. Mild toffee and nuttiness come in late. Secondary scents of fruitcake and dehydrated fruits from cherries, apples, pineapples, dates, figs, and raisons swirl around a light rum-like sweetness. Promises greatness.\\\\n\\\\nOutstanding flavors of the fruits, breads, and alcohols that are described in the nose transfer unadulterated to the taste but with less heaviness or boldness than expected. Still, the heavy emphasis is on the bready, melanoiden meaty flavors with a touch of soy-sauce aging. Toffee and nuttiness round on the the malts and make them identifiable.\\\\n\\\\nThe body can be summed up in one word: Malty. Of course the bready notes come full throddle with a creamy, robust, full texture. But all that seems to whisp away in a magical last second. Part of the beer evaporates while the otehr parts thin into a toasty-sweet beer that makes for remarkable drinkability.\\\\n\\\\nCelebrator is one of the few true Dopplebocks the exemplifly the style to perfection. Could it use a bit more complexity on the fruits and a bit more balance on the lagered-oxidized front? Maybe, but no faults here.Jul 18, 2005\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\\', \\'look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark bread, wheat/grain, caramel, and some subtle cocoa aromas. Taste is of dark wheat/multi-grain bread, caramel, and some cocoa flavors on the finish. I am also getting some dark fruit flavors as the beer warms. This beer has a slightly crisp carbonation level with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a very nice set of flavors that work together extremely well.Mar 30, 2012\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\\', \"look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5330ml bottle, this was a favourite at an office party where I provided the input to the beer selection, a few years ago, at least now. Time to enjoy it while off the clock, I suppose.\\\\n\\\\nThis beer pours a moderately hazy, deep dark cola colour, with a multitude of foamy, bubbly, and somewhat creamy beige head, which leaves some solid spidery lace around the glass as it gradually settles. \\\\n\\\\nIt smells of musty caramel/toffee malt, softly bittersweet sticky molasses, muddled black fruit, bready biscuit notes, and floral, spicy hops. The taste is lightly roasted caramel malt, well-aged dark fruit, slick cafe au lait, ethereal chalky cocoa, a twinge of salty nuttiness, tobacco ash, and adequately bitter leafy, earthy hops. \\\\n\\\\nThe carbonation is quite mild, but hardly absent from its underlying duties, the body medium-full in weight, subtly rich, and decently smooth by the same measure. It finishes in a nicely balanced manner, the lingering malt complexities and noble hops acting like they\\'ve been through this a few times before.\\\\n\\\\nNothing surprising here - the effusive, long-running hype is more than well deserved.

Some bottles lose most of their flavor and are not that interesting. A few others develop into a superb creamy, malty uber-bock that is very delicious. Most of these bottles were from a case that I cellared, so the differences are probably not due to batch differences. The worst of these is still ok to drink and most are still very nice, so it has been worth it for the exceptional aged bottles.Jul 31, 2012\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Report\\', \"look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass.\\\\n\\\\nA: The beer is a deep reddish brown color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.\\\\n\\\\nS: The aroma is of dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, lager yeast and a touch of hops.\\\\n\\\\nT: The taste is well balanced with flavors of chocolate, caramel and dark fruit up front.

Pours a finger thick head of tanned foam. Little bit of spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is filled with an aroma of molasses and a bit of breadiness. Taste is dark malty sweetness reminescent of...yet again molasses and a bit of caramel. Lingering taste left in the mouth similar to dark fruit. As it warms both the aroma and the taste have a bit of hop character without the bitterness. Only faintly picking up on the alcohol character. Thick chewy feel and moderate carbination but wow is it smooth. I honestly feel bad for waiting this long to try this beer, it really is an awesome doppelbock.

The smell is a little warming and inviting. The taste of the beer was had many of the elements that were on the nose, it was sweet upfront which faded into a nice caramel bitterness in the end.

The aroma has a sweet edge to it; hazelnut; very light note of roasted grain.

Heavy body; rich and sticky; very light alcohol warmth.\\\\n\\\\nWell, I toned-down some of my ratings although the taste remains a \"5\". There is a reason this beer is considered world-class. It\\\\\\'s balanced and very approachable for the style. You can\\\\\\'t go wrong with this doppelbock.\\\\n\\\\n--------------------------\\\\nThis doppelbock has it all. Rich, dark color; fat, dark fig and date and currant aroma with all the associated dark malt goodness in the smell and taste; additional tastiness in the bittering and excellent mouthfeel qualities.

Quite nice indeed.\\\\n\\\\nTaste: the flavor tracks along the same lines as the aroma. The only drawback here is that it is a little light in intensity; the composition of the flavor is very tasty, however.

Plenty of carbonation. Pretty.\\\\n\\\\nS: Bready and fruity, there\\'s freshly baked whole wheat bread, along with raisins, dates, plums and a little clove. Wholesome. Plenty of brown sugar and molasses.\\\\n\\\\nT: Opens up with pretty complex malt flavor featuring bread, raisins, plums and dates before a firm bitterness balances things out. Bitterness tastes like it\\'s mostly derived from burnt/caramelized sugar, but there\\'s also a faint earthy hop character that makes itself towards the finish, especially as the beer warms up. Mid palate has flavors of buckwheat honey and brown sugar. While having plenty of sweet flavors, this is far from cloying, and is quite tremendously enjoyable.\\\\n\\\\nM: While it is fairly light in body, it also has a little heft to it. Carbonation is moderate, ample for the beer. While the finish is great, with flavors of burnt sugar sweetness and bitterness, I wish it had a little more oomph to it, as it seems a little light compared to the rich flavors. What flavor is present lasts long, though\\\\n\\\\nD: I was supposed to savor this over 30 minutes, but it\\'s almost gone in the 10 that it took to review.

A pleasant sweetness sneaks in among the smoke and toasted malt, but only enough to make the beer delectable, not cloying in the least. Toffee and bread with a splash of dark fruit are in there as well. This beer is so delicious and still very accessible, which I find very pleasing.\\\\n\\\\nM: Medium to low in both body and carbonation.

The taste begins a little on the drier side and sweetness as notes of brown sugar and molasses enter the scene. At the end, the roastiness, when mixed with the sweet creates a somewhat sweetened coffee flavor. This brew has some very nice transitions and all the flavors at all times complement each other very nicely. Fantastic.\\\\n\\\\nMouthfeel – Quite a creamy body with a lower level of carbonation.

On the palate the flavors replicate the nose, with lots of rich malt. However, everything is in proportion with this beer, nothing is out of place.
